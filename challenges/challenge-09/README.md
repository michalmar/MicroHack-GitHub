   - Configure environment cleanup and resource management

2. **Approval Workflows**:
   - Implement manual approval gates for production deployments
   - Configure environment protection rules
   - Set up notification and escalation procedures
   - Add deployment scheduling and maintenance windows

### Task 6: Advanced Pipeline Features
1. **Matrix and Parallel Builds**:
   - Configure matrix builds for multiple environments/platforms
   - Implement parallel job execution for efficiency
   - Set up dependent job orchestration
   - Optimize build times and resource usage

2. **Reusable Workflows and Actions**:
   - Create custom composite actions
   - Implement reusable workflow templates
   - Set up organization-wide workflow standards
   - Configure workflow inheritance and standardization

### Task 7: Monitoring and Observability
1. **Pipeline Monitoring**:
   - Set up pipeline success/failure notifications
   - Configure deployment monitoring and alerting
   - Implement pipeline performance metrics
   - Set up trend analysis and reporting

2. **Application Monitoring Integration**:
   - Configure deployment annotations in monitoring systems
   - Set up automated rollback based on metrics
   - Implement canary analysis and automated promotion
   - Configure synthetic testing and monitoring

- [ ] Created reusable and maintainable workflow components
- [ ] Configured monitoring and alerting for deployments
- [ ] Documented deployment processes and runbooks

## GitHub Actions Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Organization
```yaml
# Use descriptive workflow names and organize logically
name: "CI/CD - Pet Service"

# Use appropriate triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths: ['pet-service/**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['pet-service/**']
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### 2. Security Best Practices
```yaml
# Use GitHub secrets for sensitive data
env:
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
  
# Use OIDC for Azure authentication
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

# Pin action versions for security
uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.0
```

### 3. Efficiency Optimizations
```yaml
# Use caching for dependencies
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

# Use matrix builds for parallel execution
strategy:
  matrix:
    environment: [dev, staging, prod]
```

## Pipeline Templates with Copilot

### Sample Prompts for Pipeline Generation
```
"Create a GitHub Actions workflow for a Node.js microservice with Docker build, testing, and Azure Container Apps deployment"

"Generate a CI/CD pipeline with approval gates for production deployment and rollback capabilities"

"Create reusable GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment using Bicep templates"
```

### Advanced Pipeline Patterns
```
"Implement a canary deployment workflow with automated rollback based on error rates"

"Create a matrix build pipeline for multiple environments with environment-specific configurations"

"Generate a security-focused pipeline with vulnerability scanning and compliance checks"
```

## Common Pipeline Patterns

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
- Build and test on feature branches
- Deploy to ephemeral environments for testing
- Merge to main triggers staging deployment
- Manual approval for production deployment

### 2. GitFlow Workflow
- Feature branches for development
- Develop branch for integration testing
- Release branches for production preparation
- Main branch represents production state

### 3. Trunk-Based Development
- Frequent commits to main branch
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Automated deployment to staging
- Production deployment with approval gates

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Maintain two identical production environments
- Deploy to inactive environment and test
- Switch traffic to new environment atomically
- Keep old environment for quick rollback

### Canary Deployment
- Deploy new version to small subset of users
- Monitor metrics and error rates
- Gradually increase traffic to new version
- Automated rollback on failure detection

### Rolling Deployment
- Replace instances gradually across the cluster
- Maintain service availability during deployment
- Monitor health checks during rollout
- Stop deployment on failure detection

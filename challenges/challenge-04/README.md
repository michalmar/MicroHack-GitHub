# Challenge 04: Collaborative Change Design using GitHub Issues / Discussions

## Overview

Participants define requirements for future work directly in the form of GitHub Issues. This includes thinking about how to transform business requirements into technical tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn to use GitHub Issues for project management and collaboration
- Understand how to break down business requirements into technical tasks
- Practice collaborative discussion and decision-making
- Experience GitHub's project management features

## Prerequisites

- Access to GitHub repository with Issues enabled
- Understanding of the existing pet management microservices
- Basic knowledge of software requirements gathering

## Tasks

### Task 1: Explore Current System
1. Review the existing pet management system architecture
2. Understand the current microservices (Pet Service, Activity Service, Accessory Service)
3. Identify areas for improvement or new features
4. Document your findings in a GitHub Discussion

### Task 2: Business Requirements Analysis
Work with your team to identify and discuss potential new features:

**Potential Features to Consider:**
- Pet health tracking and veterinary appointment management
- Pet social features (playdates, pet matching)
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile application companion
- Integration with external services (veterinary clinics, pet stores)
- Real-time notifications and alerts

### Task 3: Create Structured GitHub Issues
For each identified feature, create a GitHub Issue with:

1. **Clear Title**: Descriptive and specific
2. **Business Context**: Why this feature is needed
3. **User Stories**: Who benefits and how
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: What defines "done"
5. **Technical Considerations**: High-level implementation notes
6. **Dependencies**: What needs to happen first
7. **Effort Estimation**: Rough complexity assessment

### Task 4: Use GitHub Project Management Features
1. Create a GitHub Project board
2. Organize issues into columns (Backlog, In Progress, Done)
3. Add labels for categorization (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
4. Assign issues to team members
5. Set milestones for related features

### Task 5: Collaborative Discussion
1. Use GitHub Discussions for broader architectural decisions
2. Comment on each other's issues with questions and suggestions
3. Refine requirements based on team feedback
4. Prioritize issues based on business value and technical complexity

### Task 6: From Business to Technical
Transform at least one business requirement into detailed technical tasks:

1. Break down the feature into smaller, manageable tasks
2. Identify required API changes, database schema updates, etc.
3. Create linked issues for each technical component
4. Document integration points with existing services
5. Consider testing and deployment requirements

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Created at least 3 well-structured GitHub Issues
- [ ] Participated in collaborative discussions about requirements
- [ ] Successfully broke down a business requirement into technical tasks
- [ ] Used GitHub project management features effectively
- [ ] Demonstrated understanding of requirements gathering process
- [ ] Created clear, actionable technical specifications

## Templates to Use

### Issue Template for New Features
```markdown
## Business Context
Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve?

## User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
- [ ] Criteria 3

## Technical Notes
High-level implementation considerations

## Dependencies
What needs to be completed first?

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
```

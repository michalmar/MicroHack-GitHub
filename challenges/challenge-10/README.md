## DevSecOps Pipeline Architecture

### Security Integration Points
```yaml
# Example security-integrated pipeline
name: Secure CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Run SAST scan
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      
      - name: Dependency check
        uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
      
      - name: Container security scan
        uses: anchore/scan-action@v3

## Approval Workflow Patterns

### 1. Risk-Based Approvals
```yaml
# High-risk changes require additional approvals
environment:
  name: production
  protection_rules:
    required_reviewers:
      - security-team
      - architecture-team
    wait_timer: 60  # minutes
```

### 2. Time-Based Controls
```yaml
# Deployments only during business hours
deployment_branch_policy:
  protected_branches: true
  custom_branch_policies: true
deployment_protection_rules:
  - type: required_reviewers
    reviewers:
      - deployment-team
  - type: wait_timer
    wait_timer: 30
```

### 3. Conditional Approvals
```yaml
# Auto-approve low-risk changes
if: |
  contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[auto-approve]') &&
  github.event.pull_request.changed_files < 10
```

## Security Metrics and KPIs

### Security Metrics to Track
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) for security vulnerabilities
- Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for security issues
- Security scan coverage percentage
- False positive rate for security tools
- Security training completion rates
- Compliance policy adherence rates

### Compliance Metrics
- Audit finding resolution time
- Policy exception approval time
- Compliance report generation frequency

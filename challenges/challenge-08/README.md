   - Implement distributed tracing infrastructure

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Configure Azure Security Center recommendations
   - Set up Azure Sentinel for security monitoring
   - Implement audit logging and compliance reporting
   - Configure vulnerability scanning and assessment

### Task 6: Deployment Automation
1. **Infrastructure Deployment Pipeline**:
   - Create automated infrastructure deployment scripts
   - Implement infrastructure testing and validation
   - Set up environment promotion pipelines
   - Configure rollback and disaster recovery procedures

2. **Configuration Drift Management**:
   - Implement infrastructure state monitoring
   - Set up configuration drift detection
   - Plan automated remediation strategies
   - Configure compliance and governance policies

### Task 7: Security Best Practices Implementation
1. **Identity Security**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication requirements
   - Configure privileged identity management
   - Set up identity governance and access reviews
   - Implement emergency access procedures

2. **Data Security**:
   - Configure encryption at rest and in transit
   - Implement data classification and protection
   - Set up data loss prevention policies
   - Configure backup encryption and key management

3. **Application Security**:
   - Implement Web Application Firewall rules
   - Configure API rate limiting and throttling
   - Set up application security scanning
   - Implement secure coding practices validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully deployed microservice to Azure using IaC
- [ ] Implemented proper identity and access management
- [ ] Applied security best practices throughout the deployment
- [ ] Configured monitoring and observability infrastructure
- [ ] Created automated deployment and management processes
- [ ] Validated security controls and compliance requirements
- [ ] Documented architecture and operational procedures

## Infrastructure as Code with Copilot

### Bicep Template Generation
```
"Create a Bicep template for Azure Container Apps environment with managed identity"

"Generate Azure SQL Database configuration with private endpoint"

"Create Key Vault setup with RBAC permissions for container apps"
```

### Terraform Configuration
```
"Generate Terraform configuration for Azure Container Registry with admin user disabled"

"Create Terraform module for Azure networking with security groups"

"Generate Azure Monitor and Application Insights setup in Terraform"
```

## Security Principles and Best Practices

### 1. Identity and Access Management
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Identity as Security Perimeter**: Use strong identity controls
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review and update permissions

### 2. Data Protection
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Encryption Everywhere**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- **Data Classification**: Classify and protect sensitive data appropriately
- **Backup Security**: Secure and test backup and recovery procedures

### 3. Network Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate services and limit lateral movement
- **Private Networking**: Use private endpoints and service endpoints
- **Traffic Encryption**: Ensure all network traffic is encrypted
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Log and monitor all network activity

### 4. Application Security
- **Secure Development**: Implement secure coding practices
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular security scanning and patching
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling and logging

## Azure Security Services Integration

### Core Security Services
- **Azure Active Directory**: Identity and access management
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secrets and key management
- **Azure Security Center**: Security posture management
- **Azure Sentinel**: Security information and event management

### Compliance and Governance
- **Azure Policy**: Compliance and governance automation
- **Azure Blueprints**: Repeatable environment deployment
- **Azure Resource Manager**: Infrastructure lifecycle management
- **Azure Cost Management**: Resource optimization and control

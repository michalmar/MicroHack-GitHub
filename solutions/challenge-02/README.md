# Solution: Challenge 02 - GitHub Spark Introduction & Prototype Exercise

This solution demonstrates effective use of GitHub Spark for AI-assisted prototyping and development.

> Disclaimer! This solution provides just a single possible approach. Your own Spark-generated prototype may differ in structure, styling, or implementation details based on your prompts and iterations.

## Full Solution Prompt (Reference – DO NOT RUN UNTIL AFTER YOU FINISH THE CHALLENGE ITERATIONS)
Use this comprehensive prompt ONLY after you’ve attempted iterative refinement. It is here for benchmarking / learning.

```
You are designing a front-end prototype for a sample microservices app called “PetPal”. Goal: Build a clean, playful, responsive UI that demonstrates integration with 3 microservices: (1) Pet Service (DB-backed)  (2) Activity Service  (3) Accessory Service \

=== VIBE & BRAND ===

Tone: playful but professional; approachable, educational.
Visuals: soft rounded cards, subtle shadows, micro-animations.
Color palette: pastel teal (#30C5C2), coral (#FF7A7A), sunflower (#FFC857), deep navy text (#1F2A44), soft gray backgrounds (#F6F7FB).
Typography: Inter or Manrope; large friendly headings.
Iconography: minimal line icons + pet emojis 🐶🐱🐾 where tasteful.
Dark mode support.

=== REQUIREMENTS ===
1. Provide component structure: AppShell, NavBar, ThemeToggle, PetList, PetCard, PetDetail, ActivityTimeline, AccessoryPlaceholder, SuggestActivityButton.
2. Use mock data modules only; NO real fetch calls yet.
3. Include placeholders / TODO comments for integrating each microservice.
4. Implement light & dark themes with accessible contrast.
5. Add subtle hover transitions and card lift.
6. Provide README section (as code comment or markdown string) describing future integration points.
7. Include a mock AI suggestion action (logs a random recommended activity).

Generate code organized by folder (components/, mock/, theme/, hooks/). Keep React, TypeScript, functional components. Provide index export barrels where helpful.

# MicroHack: GitHub for Modern Development

Welcome to the GitHub MicroHack! This hands-on workshop explores modern software development practices using GitHub's comprehensive development platform. Learn how to leverage AI assistance, implement robust DevSecOps practices, and build scalable microservices architectures.

## Workshop Overview

This MicroHack guides you through a comprehensive journey of modern development practices, from basic GitHub concepts to advanced AI-assisted development and enterprise-scale DevSecOps implementation.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master GitHub's collaborative development features and workflows
- Experience AI-assisted development with GitHub Copilot
- Implement modern CI/CD pipelines with advanced security integration
- Build and deploy microservices using cloud-native technologies
- Understand enterprise-scale development governance and best practices

### 🏗️ Sample Application

The workshop uses a fictious **PetPal** application, a playful microservices‑based application that helps users manage their pets, track activities, and explore accessories.

#### Backend Services
- **🐾 Pet Service** (Port 8010) - Core pet management with CRUD operations
- **📊 Activity Service** (Port 8020) - Pet activity tracking and analytics  
- **🛍️ Accessory Service** (Port 8030) - Inventory management for pet accessories (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)

Each service demonstrates modern development practices including:
- RESTful API design with FastAPI
- Azure CosmosDB integration
- Containerization with Docker
- Comprehensive testing strategies
- OpenAPI documentation
- Health monitoring and observability

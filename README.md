# MicroHack: GitHub for Modern Development

Welcome to the GitHub MicroHack! This hands-on workshop explores modern software development practices using GitHub's comprehensive development platform. Learn how to leverage AI assistance, implement robust DevSecOps practices, and build scalable microservices architectures.

## Workshop Overview

This MicroHack guides you through a comprehensive journey of modern development practices, from basic GitHub concepts to advanced AI-assisted development and enterprise-scale DevSecOps implementation.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

- Master GitHub's collaborative development features and workflows
- Experience AI-assisted development with GitHub Copilot
- Implement modern CI/CD pipelines with advanced security integration
- Build and deploy microservices using cloud-native technologies
- Understand enterprise-scale development governance and best practices

### üèóÔ∏è Sample Application

The workshop uses a **Pet Management System** built with microservices architecture:

#### Backend Services
- **üêæ Pet Service** (Port 8000) - Core pet management with CRUD operations
- **üìä Activity Service** (Port 8001) - Pet activity tracking and analytics  
- **üõçÔ∏è Accessory Service** (Port 8002) - Inventory management for pet accessories

Each service demonstrates modern development practices including:
- RESTful API design with FastAPI
- Azure CosmosDB integration
- Containerization with Docker
- Comprehensive testing strategies
- OpenAPI documentation
- Health monitoring and observability
